# Sharper
Sharper is a backend for developing games based on MonoGame.

Currently i work on the level editor at the same time adding more stuff to the backend.
The camera in the editor is controlled using scroll (zoom) and middle mouse button to pan the view.


Getting this to work:
1. Install Monogame according to [this](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/2_choosing_your_ide_visual_studio.html) documentation. Stopping at step 6.
2. Open the solution file
3. in Program.cs change out GameFile for your own.
4. Make whatever you want.
